3SqauresVT Eligibility Calculator

This web page is a calculator to determine if a household is eligible for a
3SquaresVT (i.e. food stamps) benefit, provided by [Hunger Free
Vermont](https://www.hungerfreevt.org/). It is implemented as a static site
(i.e. no  server-side scripting), and uses only client-side javascript. Though
it functions like a multi-page web site, this is accomplished by showing/hiding
`div` elements.

In addition to the main.js file, it also uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com). I
am thankful for the availability of such useful and well designed open source
software.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open index.html in a browser.
