3SqauresVT Eligibility Calculator

This web page is a calculator to determine if a household is eligible for a 3SquaresVT (i.e. food stamps) benefit. It is designed
to be static (i.e. no server-side scripting), and uses only client-side javascript. Though it functions like a multi-page web site,
this is accomplished by showing/hiding `div` elements.

In addition to the main.js file, it also uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open index.html in a browser.
